## playwright.config.ts for CI

```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: "./tests",
  fullyParallel: true,

  // CI-specific settings
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,

  reporter: [
    ["html", { open: "never" }],
    ["junit", { outputFile: "test-results/results.xml" }],
    ...(process.env.CI ? [["github"] as const] : []),
  ],

  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",

    // Capture traces on first retry
    trace: "on-first-retry",

    // Screenshots and video on failure
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",
    video: "retain-on-failure",
  },

  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] },
    },
    {
      name: "webkit",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Safari"] },
    },
  ],

  // Start app server before tests
  webServer: process.env.CI
    ? undefined // CI handles app startup separately
    : {
        command: "npm run dev",
        url: "http://localhost:3000",
        reuseExistingServer: true,
      },
});
```

---

## Trace Viewer in CI

Always enable traces in CI for debugging failures:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
use: {
  trace: 'on-first-retry', // Captures trace on first retry
  // Or for all failures:
  trace: 'retain-on-failure',
}
```

View traces locally:

```bash
# Download artifact and run
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

---

## Playwright v1.57+ Features

### Browser Channels (Chrome/Edge)

Playwright ships bundled browsers optimized for reliability. If you also want parity checks against stable Chrome/Edge, run an extra project using a browser channel:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chrome",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"], channel: "chrome" },
    },
    {
      name: "edge",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Edge"], channel: "msedge" },
    },
  ],
});
```

### Speedboard (HTML Reporter)

New "Speedboard" tab shows all tests sorted by execution time:

```bash
# Generate report with speedboard
npx playwright test
npx playwright show-report
# Navigate to "Speedboard" tab to identify slow tests
```

### webServer wait Option

Wait for specific log output before starting tests:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: "npm run dev",
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
    wait: /ready in \d+ms/, // Wait for this log pattern
  },
});
```

### Fail CI on Rerun-Pass Flakes (Recommended)

Goal: keep retries in CI (to capture traces) but still fail if a test only passes on retry.

Implementation pattern:

1. Copy `assets/template-playwright-fail-on-flaky-reporter.js` into your repo (example: `playwright/fail-on-flaky-reporter.js`).
2. Register it in `reporter`:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  retries: 2,
  reporter: [
    ["html", { open: "never" }],
    ["junit", { outputFile: "test-results/results.xml" }],
    ["./playwright/fail-on-flaky-reporter.js"],
  ],
});
```

### Service Worker Network Routing (Chromium)

Network requests from Service Workers are now routable:

```typescript
test("intercept service worker requests", async ({ context }) => {
  await context.route("**/api/**", (route) => {
    route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: "mocked" });
  });
  // Service Worker requests are now intercepted
});
```

Opt out with: `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_NETWORK=1`

## Real Device Testing (2026)

### BrowserStack Integration

BrowserStack supports Playwright on real iOS devices:

```typescript
// browserstack.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    connectOptions: {
      wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.browserstack.com/playwright?caps=${encodeURIComponent(
        JSON.stringify({
          browser: "playwright-webkit",
          os: "ios",
          os_version: "17",
          device: "iPhone 15 Pro",
          "browserstack.username": process.env.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME,
          "browserstack.accessKey": process.env.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY,
        }),
      )}`,
    },
  },
});
```

**Supported:**

Cloud providers support a rotating set of iOS versions and devices. Prefer the newest stable iOS Safari available in the provider's device list and pin the capabilities in CI.

### LambdaTest Integration

```typescript
// lambdatest.config.ts
const caps = {
  browserName: "webkit",
  browserVersion: "latest",
  "LT:Options": {
    platform: "ios",
    deviceName: "iPhone 15",
    isRealMobile: true,
  },
};

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    connectOptions: {
      wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(caps))}`,
    },
  },
});
```

### Android Real Device via ADB

Connect to real Android devices:

```typescript
import { _android as android } from "playwright";

const [device] = await android.devices();
const context = await device.launchBrowser();
const page = await context.newPage();

await page.goto("https://example.com");
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/);

await context.close();
await device.close();
```

### Real Device Testing Decision Matrix

| Platform       | Emulation             | Real Device (Cloud)          | Real Device (Local) |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| iOS Safari     | WARNING: WebKit proxy | PASS BrowserStack/LambdaTest | FAIL Not supported  |
| Android Chrome | PASS Full support     | PASS Cloud providers         | PASS ADB connection |
| Desktop        | PASS Full support     | PASS Cloud providers         | PASS Local browsers |

**When to use real devices:**

- iOS Safari-specific bugs (WebKit emulation differs)
- Mobile-specific features (camera, GPS, push)
- Performance testing on actual hardware
- Compliance testing requiring real devices

## Updated Docker Images

Use latest Playwright Docker images:

```yaml
# GitLab CI
playwright:
