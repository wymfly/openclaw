# Playwright Preflight: Sandbox, Port, Timeout, Lock

Use this preflight before running expensive E2E suites in local sandboxes or CI containers.

## 1) Verify Target Specs and Working Directory

```bash
pwd
rg --files e2e/tests | rg "<target-spec-or-pattern>"
```

If spec paths are missing, stop and fix path assumptions first.

## 2) Port and Host Binding Check

```bash
# Replace 3000 with configured webServer port
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Decision rules:

- `EADDRINUSE`: free the port or choose a different port.
- `EPERM` / `EACCES` bind errors: escalate immediately; do not retry loops.
- If environment disallows `0.0.0.0`, force `127.0.0.1` for local-only runs.

## 3) Build Lock and Stale Process Hygiene

```bash
# Find stale Next.js / test runners
ps aux | rg "next build|next dev|playwright"

# Inspect lock file
ls -la .next/lock
```

If lock exists and no active build owns it, remove lock and rerun.

## 4) Timeout Budget (Per-Test, Not Global)

Default policy:

- smoke tests: 30-60s/test
- API-heavy flows (generation/checkout/report): 90-180s/test

Apply timeout only to affected tests/steps. Avoid raising global timeout for the whole suite.

## 5) Escalation Decision

Escalate run permissions when all are true:

- failure is environment-level (`EPERM`, restricted bind, blocked process inspection), and
- command is required for requested validation, and
- no safe non-escalated alternative exists.

## 6) Execution Sequence

1. Reproduce one failing test with `--workers=1`.
2. Capture trace artifacts.
3. Fix determinism cause.
4. Rerun targeted suite.
5. Run broader regression last.
