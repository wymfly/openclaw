# QA Testing Strategy (Jan 2026)

Risk-based quality engineering strategy for modern software delivery.

**Core references**: curated links in `data/sources.json` (SLOs/error budgets, contracts, E2E, OpenTelemetry). Start with `references/operational-playbook.md` for a compact, navigable overview.

## Scope

- Create or update a risk-based test strategy (what to test, where, and why)
- Define quality gates and release criteria (merge vs deploy)
- Select the smallest effective layer (unit → integration → contract → E2E)
- Make failures diagnosable (artifacts, logs/traces, ownership)
- Operationalize reliability (flake SLO, quarantines, suite budgets)

## Use Instead

| Test LLM agents/personas            | [qa-agent-testing](../qa-agent-testing/SKILL.md)                 |

## Quick Reference

| Test Type     | Goal                                | Typical Use                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Unit          | Prove logic and invariants fast     | Pure functions, core business rules   |
| Component     | Validate UI behavior in isolation   | UI components and state transitions   |
| Integration   | Validate boundaries with real deps  | API + DB, queues, external adapters   |
| Contract      | Prevent breaking changes cross-team | OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schema/Protobuf |
| E2E           | Validate critical user journeys     | 1–2 “money paths” per product area    |
| Performance   | Enforce budgets and capacity        | Load, stress, soak, regression trends |
| Visual        | Catch UI regressions                | Layout/visual diffs on stable pages   |
| Accessibility | Automate WCAG checks                | axe smoke + targeted manual audits    |
| Security      | Catch common web vulns early        | DAST smoke + critical checks in CI    |

## Default Workflow

1. Clarify scope and risk: critical journeys, failure modes, and non-functional risks (latency, data loss, auth).
2. Define quality signals: SLOs/error budgets, contract/schema checks, and what blocks merge vs blocks deploy.
3. Choose the smallest effective layer (unit → integration → contract → E2E).
4. Make failures diagnosable: artifacts + correlation IDs (logs/traces/screenshots), clear ownership, deflake runbook.
5. Operationalize: flake SLO, quarantine with expiry, suite budgets (PR gate vs scheduled), dashboards.

## Test Pyramid

```text
           /\
          /E2E\          5-10% - Critical journeys
         /------\
        /Integr. \       15-25% - API, DB, queues
       /----------\
      /Component \       20-30% - UI modules
     /------------\
    /   Unit      \      40-60% - Logic and invariants
   /--------------\
```

## Decision Tree: Test Strategy

```text
Need to test: [Feature Type]
    │
    ├─ Pure business logic/invariants? → Unit tests (mock boundaries)
    │
    ├─ UI component/state transitions? → Component tests
    │   └─ Cross-page user journey? → E2E tests
    │
    ├─ API Endpoint?
    │   ├─ Single service boundary? → Integration tests (real DB/deps)
    │   └─ Cross-service compatibility? → Contract tests (schema/versioning)
    │
    ├─ Event-driven/API schema evolution? → Contract + backward-compat tests
    │
    └─ Performance-critical? → k6 load testing
```

## Core QA Principles

### Definition of Done

- Strategy is risk-based: critical journeys + failure modes explicit
- Test portfolio is layered: fast checks catch most defects
- CI is economical: fast pre-merge gates, heavy suites scheduled
- Failures are diagnosable: actionable artifacts (logs/trace/screenshots)
- Flakes managed with SLO and deflake runbook

### Shift-Left Gates (Pre-Merge)

- Contracts: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/JSON Schema validation
- Static checks: lint, typecheck, secret scanning
- Fast tests: unit + key integration (avoid full E2E as PR gate)

### Shift-Right (Post-Deploy)

- Synthetic checks for critical paths (monitoring-as-tests)
- Canary analysis: compare SLO signals and key metrics before ramping
- Feature flags for safe rollouts and fast rollback
- Convert incidents into regression tests (prefer lower layers first)

### CI Economics

| Budget          | Target                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| PR gate         | p50 ≤ 10 min, p95 ≤ 20 min |
| Mainline health | ≥ 99% green builds/day     |

### Flake Management

- Define: test fails without product change, passes on rerun
- Track weekly: `flaky_failures / total_test_executions` (where `flaky_failure = fail_then_pass_on_rerun`)
- SLO: Suite flake rate ≤ 1% weekly
- Quarantine policy with owner and expiry
- Use the deflake runbook: [template-flaky-test-triage-deflake-runbook.md](assets/runbooks/template-flaky-test-triage-deflake-runbook.md)

## Common Patterns

### AAA Pattern

```javascript
it("should apply discount", () => {
  // Arrange
  const order = { total: 150 };
  // Act
  const result = calculateDiscount(order);
  // Assert
  expect(result.discount).toBe(15);
});
```

### Page Object Model (E2E)

```typescript
class LoginPage {
  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', email);
    await this.page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', password);
    await this.page.click('[data-testid="submit"]');
  }
}
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern           | Problem            | Solution          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Testing implementation | Breaks on refactor | Test behavior     |
| Shared mutable state   | Flaky tests        | Isolate test data |
| sleep() in tests       | Slow, unreliable   | Use proper waits  |
| Everything E2E         | Slow, expensive    | Use test pyramid  |
| Ignoring flaky tests   | False confidence   | Fix or quarantine |

## Do / Avoid

### Do

- Write tests against stable contracts and user-visible behavior
- Treat flaky tests as P1 reliability work
- Make "how to debug this failure" part of every suite

### Avoid

- "Everything E2E" as default
- Sleeps/time-based waits (use event-based)
- Coverage % as primary quality KPI

## Feature Matrix vs Test Matrix Gate (Release Blocking)

Before release, run a coverage audit that maps product features/backlog IDs to direct test evidence.

### Gate Rules

- Every release-scoped feature must map to at least one direct automated test, or an explicit waiver with owner/date.
- Evidence must include file path and test identifier (suite/spec/case).
- "Covered indirectly" is not accepted without written rationale and risk acknowledgment.
- If critical features have no direct evidence, release is blocked.

### Minimal Audit Output

- feature/backlog id
- coverage status (`direct`, `indirect`, `none`)
- evidence reference
- risk level
- owner and due date for gaps

## Ops Gate: Release-Safe Verification Sequence

Use this sequence for feature branches that touch user flows, pricing, localization, or analytics.

```bash
# 1) Static checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck

# 2) Fast correctness
npm run test:unit

# 3) Critical path checks
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "@critical"

# 4) Instrumentation gate (if configured)
npm run test:analytics-gate

# 5) Production build
npm run build
```

### If a Gate Fails

1. Capture exact failing command and first error line.
2. Classify: environment issue, baseline known failure, or regression.
3. Re-run only the failed gate once after fix.
4. Do not continue to later gates while earlier required gates are red.

### Agent Output Contract for QA Handoff

Always report:

- commands run,
- pass/fail per gate,
- whether failures are pre-existing or introduced,
- next blocking action.

## Fact-Checking

- Use web search/web fetch to verify current external facts, versions, pricing, deadlines, regulations, or platform behavior before final answers.
- Prefer primary sources; report source links and dates for volatile information.
- If web access is unavailable, state the limitation and mark guidance as unverified.
