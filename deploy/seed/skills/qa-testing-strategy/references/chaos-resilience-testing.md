## When to Use This Reference

- Validating system resilience before major releases
- Preparing for compliance audits (DORA, SOC 2)
- Building confidence in disaster recovery plans
- Testing failover mechanisms and circuit breakers
- Validating auto-scaling and self-healing infrastructure

## Core Principles

### Build-Measure-Learn Cycle

```text
1. STEADY STATE
   Define normal behavior metrics (latency, error rate, throughput)

2. HYPOTHESIS
   "The system will maintain <metric> within <threshold> when <failure>"

3. EXPERIMENT
   Inject controlled failure in staging/production

4. OBSERVE
   Measure deviation from steady state

5. LEARN
   Fix weaknesses, update runbooks, repeat
```

### Blast Radius Containment

| Environment         | Blast Radius      | Approval               |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Development         | Full chaos        | None                   |
| Staging             | Targeted services | Team lead              |
| Production (canary) | 1-5% traffic      | SRE + Engineering lead |
| Production (full)   | Full system       | VP Engineering + SRE   |

**Rule:** Start small, expand gradually, always have a kill switch.

## Compliance: DORA & SOC 2

### DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)

DORA requires financial entities to regularly test ICT resilience. Chaos engineering provides:

| DORA Requirement                       | Chaos Engineering Practice  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ICT risk management                    | Proactive failure discovery |
| ICT-related incident management        | Runbook validation          |
| Digital operational resilience testing | Chaos experiments           |
| Third-party risk management            | Dependency failure testing  |
| Information sharing                    | Post-mortem culture         |

### SOC 2 Alignment

| SOC 2 Criteria       | Chaos Engineering Evidence       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Availability         | Uptime during chaos experiments  |
| Processing Integrity | Data consistency after failures  |
| Confidentiality      | Access controls during incidents |
| Security             | Attack surface validation        |

### Audit Documentation

```markdown
## Chaos Experiment Report

**Experiment ID:** CHX-2026-001
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Environment:** Production (5% canary)
**Conducted By:** SRE Team

### Hypothesis

The payment service will maintain <100ms p99 latency when
the primary database fails over to replica.

### Experiment Details

- **Attack Type:** Database primary termination
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Blast Radius:** 5% of production traffic
- **Kill Switch:** Immediate rollback via feature flag

### Results

| Metric        | Baseline | During Experiment | Pass/Fail |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| p99 Latency   | 45ms     | 120ms             | FAIL      |
| Error Rate    | 0.01%    | 0.8%              | FAIL      |
| Failover Time | N/A      | 45s               | N/A       |

### Findings

1. Connection pool not warming on failover
2. DNS TTL too high (300s → should be 30s)
3. Health checks not detecting stale connections

### Remediation

- [ ] Implement connection pool pre-warming
- [ ] Reduce DNS TTL to 30s
- [ ] Add active health checks to connection pool

## Steady State Metrics

### Define Before Experimenting

```yaml
steady_state:
  metrics:
    - name: error_rate
      query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))"
      threshold: "< 0.01" # 1%

    - name: p99_latency
      query: "histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))"
      threshold: "< 0.2" # 200ms

    - name: throughput
      query: "sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))"
      threshold: "> 1000" # 1000 RPS

    - name: saturation
      query: "avg(container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes)"
      threshold: "< 0.8" # 80%
```

### SLO-Based Thresholds

| SLI           | SLO        | Chaos Threshold                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Availability  | 99.9%      | Error rate < 5% during experiment |
| Latency (p99) | < 200ms    | < 500ms during experiment         |
| Throughput    | > 1000 RPS | > 800 RPS during experiment       |

---

## Best Practices

### Do

- Start with read-only experiments (latency, not data corruption)
- Run experiments during business hours (team available)
- Have clear rollback procedures before starting
- Document hypotheses and results
- Share learnings across teams
- Automate recurring experiments in CI/CD

### Avoid

- Running in production without staging validation first
- Experiments without clear success criteria
- Chaos without observability (you won't know what happened)
- Skipping post-mortems after failures
- Running during incident response or high-traffic events

---

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Define steady state metrics (error rate, latency, throughput)
- [ ] Choose chaos tool (LitmusChaos for K8s, Gremlin for enterprise)
- [ ] Start in development/staging environment
- [ ] Write first hypothesis: "System X will maintain Y when Z fails"
- [ ] Run experiment with minimal blast radius
- [ ] Document findings and remediation
- [ ] Schedule recurring experiments (weekly/monthly)
- [ ] Integrate with CI/CD for pre-release validation
