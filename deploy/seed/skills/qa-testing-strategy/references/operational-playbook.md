## Core Testing Principles

### Test Pyramid Distribution

```
       /\
      /E2E\         5-10% - End-to-end tests (critical paths)
     /------\
    /  API  \       15-25% - API/Integration tests
   /----------\
  / Component \     20-30% - Component tests
 /--------------\
/      Unit       \ 40-60% - Unit tests (fast, isolated)
```

**Rationale:**

- **Unit tests**: Fast (ms), isolated, easy to debug, cheap to maintain
- **Component tests**: Balance speed + integration, good for business logic
- **Integration tests**: Test service interactions, catch integration issues
- **E2E tests**: Expensive but validate critical user journeys

### Core Themes

- Clarify what to test vs what to assume
- Use fast, deterministic unit tests for core logic
- Use integration tests for cross-service flows
- Use E2E tests only for critical user paths
- Keep flaky tests out of required gates; fix or quarantine them
- Mock external boundaries, use real implementations internally
- Test behavior, not implementation details

## Pattern: Test Pyramid

Use this pattern to balance test types for optimal speed, coverage, and maintainability.

**Structure:**

**Base: Unit tests (40-60%)**

- Many, fast, close to the code
- No network, filesystem, or external services
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test business logic in isolation

**Middle: Integration tests (30-40%)**

- Fewer, slower, validate interactions
- Test with real databases, queues, external services (or Docker containers)
- Verify cross-component contracts

**Top: E2E/system tests (5-10%)**

- Small number, slowest, cover critical user journeys
- Test complete workflows through UI
- Focus on happy paths and critical edge cases

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Most new logic has unit tests
- [ ] Cross-service flows have integration or E2E coverage
- [ ] Avoid over-relying on UI-only tests for backend behavior
- [ ] Flaky tests are quarantined and fixed, not ignored
- [ ] Tests run in parallel where possible

---

## Pattern: Given–When–Then (BDD)

Use for tests that encode requirements clearly in natural language.

**Structure:**

- **Given**: Initial state and inputs (setup)
- **When**: Action under test (execution)
- **Then**: Expected observable outcomes (assertions)

**Example (Gherkin):**

```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter email "user@example.com"
  And I enter password "SecurePass123"
  And I click the "Login" button
  Then I should see my dashboard
  And I should see "Welcome back, John"
```

**Guidelines:**

- Use descriptive test names that capture Given/When/Then in plain language
- Keep each test focused on a single behavior
- Use fixtures or builders to set up complex state without hiding important details

See [assets/bdd/template-cucumber-gherkin.md](../assets/bdd/template-cucumber-gherkin.md) for full BDD implementation.

---

## Pattern: Test Data Management

Use when tests rely on non-trivial data.

**Strategies:**

**In-memory data:**

- Prefer for unit tests (fast, isolated)
- Use factories to generate test data
- Avoid global shared state

**Database tests:**

- Use transactions and rollbacks per test where possible
- Reset state between tests to avoid cross-test coupling
- Use Docker containers (Testcontainers) for integration tests

**Large datasets:**

- Use factories/builders to construct minimal required data
- Keep golden files small and understandable
- Regenerate intentionally, not automatically

**Example (Factory Pattern):**

```typescript
import { faker } from "@faker-js/faker";

export class UserFactory {
  static create(overrides = {}) {
    return {
      email: faker.internet.email(),
      name: faker.person.fullName(),
      age: faker.number.int({ min: 18, max: 80 }),
      role: "user",
      ...overrides,
    };
  }

  static createMany(count: number, overrides = {}) {
    return Array.from({ length: count }, () => this.create(overrides));
  }
}
```

See [references/test-automation-patterns.md](test-automation-patterns.md) for more data management patterns.

---

## Pattern: CI Test Gates

Use when wiring tests into CI/CD pipelines.

**Stages:**

**Fast linting and unit tests:**

- Run on every push and PR
- Fail fast on style or obvious logic errors
- Target: < 5 minutes

**Integration and E2E tests:**

- Run on main branch and release branches
- Gate deployments for critical services
- Target: < 15 minutes

**Performance and security tests:**

- Run nightly or on release branches
- Track trends over time
- Target: < 30 minutes

**Flaky tests:**

- Track flakiness explicitly (retry count, failure rate)
- Quarantine or stabilize them instead of ignoring failures
- Use tags (@flaky) to separate from required gates

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Unit tests run on every commit
- [ ] Integration tests run on PR and main branch
- [ ] E2E tests run on staging before production deploy
- [ ] Performance tests run nightly with trend analysis
- [ ] Security scans run on every PR (OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- [ ] Flaky tests are tracked and fixed, not ignored

See [assets/automation-pipeline-template.md](../assets/automation-pipeline-template.md) for CI/CD pipeline blueprint.

## Quick Reference: Framework Selection (2026)

### Unit Testing

**Jest** - Best for:

- React applications (built-in React Testing Library support)
- Zero-config setup preference
- Extensive mocking capabilities

**Vitest** - Best for:

- Vite-based projects (instant compatibility)
- Speed priority (native ESM, parallel execution)
- Modern tooling (watch mode, UI mode)

**Verdict:** Vitest for new Vite projects, Jest for React/established codebases.

### E2E Testing

**Playwright** - Best for:

- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Parallel execution by default
- Network interception and API mocking
- Mobile device emulation

**Cypress** - Best for:

- Real-time reloading and time-travel debugging
- Easier learning curve
- Excellent developer experience

**Verdict:** Playwright for comprehensive cross-browser coverage, Cypress for developer ergonomics.

### Performance Testing

**k6** - Best for:

- Developer-centric (JavaScript DSL)
- Modern CI/CD integration
- Grafana Cloud integration
- Protocol Buffers/gRPC support

**JMeter** - Best for:

- Legacy systems
- GUI-based test creation
- Java ecosystem

**Verdict:** k6 for modern applications, JMeter for legacy/Java ecosystems.

See [data/sources.json](../data/sources.json) for complete framework references and official documentation.

## Coverage Goals

**Critical paths**: 100%

- Authentication, payment processing, data persistence
- Security-sensitive operations

**Business logic**: 90%+

- Service layer, domain models
- Validation, calculations, workflows

**Overall**: 80%+

- Repository-wide average

**UI components**: 70%+

- Component rendering, user interactions

**Note:** Coverage is a metric, not a goal. Quality > quantity. Test behavior, not lines.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### BAD: Testing Implementation Details

```typescript
// Bad - Tests internal method
expect(service.internalHelper()).toBe(true);

// Good - Tests public behavior
expect(service.publicMethod()).toBe(expectedResult);
```

### BAD: Flaky Tests (Race Conditions)

```typescript
// Bad - Sleep (flaky)
await sleep(1000); // Hope data loads

// Good - Explicit wait
await expect(page.getByText("Loaded")).toBeVisible();
```

### BAD: Shared Mutable State

```typescript
// Bad - Shared across tests
let user: User;
beforeAll(() => {
  user = createUser();
});

// Good - Fresh for each test
beforeEach(() => {
  user = createUser();
});
```

### BAD: Excessive Mocking

```typescript
// Bad - Mock everything
const db = { save: jest.fn(), find: jest.fn() };
const cache = { get: jest.fn(), set: jest.fn() };

// Good - Use real implementations for internal code
const db = new InMemoryDatabase(); // Real logic
const emailService = mockEmailService(); // Mock external
```

### BAD: Brittle Selectors

```typescript
// Bad - Implementation-coupled
await page.locator(".btn.btn-primary.submit-v2").click();

// Good - Semantic
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();
await page.getByTestId("submit-button").click();
```

See [references/test-automation-patterns.md](test-automation-patterns.md) for complete anti-patterns guide.

## Testing Decision Tree

**What should I test?**

```
Is it a UI interaction?
├─ YES → E2E test (Playwright/Cypress)
└─ NO
   ├─ Is it business logic?
   │  └─ YES → Unit test (Jest/Vitest)
   └─ Is it API contract?
      └─ YES → Contract test (Pact) + Integration test
```

**Should I mock this?**

```
Is it an external service (API, payment gateway)?
├─ YES → Mock it
└─ NO
   ├─ Is it a database?
   │  ├─ Unit test → Use in-memory/mock
   │  └─ Integration test → Use real DB (Docker)
   └─ Is it internal code?
      └─ Use real implementation
```
